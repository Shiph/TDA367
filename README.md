# TDA367
Project in Chalmers course TDA367

How to run project
-------------------------
1. In IntelliJ: Import project -> build.gradle
2. Run DesktopLauncher.java. It will fail the first time, don't worry (wrong working directory)
3. Go to Run -> Edit configuration -> change working directory to ...<reponame>/core/assets
4. To configure JUnit, go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries and add the JUnit and Hamcrest jars, which are located in the JUnit folder in the repo
5. Everything should now work fine.


Implications following of a group member dropping out
---------------------------------------------------------
A few weeks in one of the group members decided to quit the course.
The group member was working with the logic of collision between characters and collision between characters and map objects.
Due to lack of communication we eventually had to suppose that the said group member had dropped out and therefore had to delegate the responsibilities that the group member had.
This made the project halt for a time but also made it harder for the rest of the group to catch up with everything else in the project.
